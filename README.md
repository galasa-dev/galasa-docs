# galasa-docs

This is the hosting site for the Galasa documentation on github pages

The content of this repo is not editable manually, rather the source code is held within the `galasa` repository in this organisation.
From there it gets built into the `galasa-docs-preview` repository.

From there it can be published to this repository.

The docs inside this repository will be available here: 
- https://galasa-dev.github.io/galasa-docs (the raw github pages site)
- https://galasa.dev (the main public site, which routes to the raw github pages site)

Note: This repository is not 'live' yet, until the DNS re-routing has been turned on.
